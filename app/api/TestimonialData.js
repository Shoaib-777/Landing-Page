        comment:'API for PMs was a quick 1-2 hour read which I found to be the most comprehensive guide which I have ever read about APIs. I especially recommend this ebook for you if you are a PM from a non technical background. This compact read is worth the read for 100% ðŸš€ðŸš€',

        comment:'Your e-book on APIs was superb. It s not that I didn t know about APIs. I understand them well and as a PM, they are an integral part of my product. However, I always had a tough time explaining it to sales folks and customers in a simple language. More often than not, ended up using the cliched restaurant waiter analogy. Your post simplifies APIs a lot. Perhaps one of the best explanation 101s out there. Keep up the good work!',

        comment:'One of the things I appreciated most about the book was the thorough coverage of different types of APIs, including REST, SOAP, and GraphQL. The author did a great job of explaining the pros and cons of each type and provided a number of useful strategies for choosing the right API for a given situation. In addition to the technical content, I also appreciated the attention the book paid to non-technical considerations such as API design, documentation, and security. Must read for anyone looking to understand APIs!',
